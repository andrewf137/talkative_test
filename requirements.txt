Please write PHP code to read the contents of a plain text file and display:
  * The total number of words
  * The average word length
  * The most frequently occurring word length
  * A list of the number of words of each length

Please submit your code in a zip file via email (to team@talkative.uk) along with instructions for its installation and use along with any assumptions you have made about what defines a word (using as a basis the rules that can be deduced from the example below)

For example given a file that contains the following text:

Hello world & good morning. The date is 18.05.2016

We would expect the following output:

Word count = 9
Average word length = 4.556
Number of words of length 1 is 1
Number of words of length 2 is 1
Number of words of length 3 is 1
Number of words of length 4 is 2
Number of words of length 5 is 2
Number of words of length 7 is 1
Number of words of length 10 is 1

The most frequently occurring word length is 2, for word lengths of 4 & 5

Note that we will test code submissions on a number of files of various lengths ranging from the above example through to the bible (http://janelwashere.com/files/bible_daily.txt).

Clue â€“ Do not forget to consider formatted numbers.

You will be marked on the following areas:
  * Performance and ability to handle large data sets
  * Styling; Code is structure and formatting
  * Ability to account for multiple use cases
